# HaloStatProject
Python code for saving Halo 2 and 3 stats from gamertags from Bungie.net

I am currently moving over the next 2 months.  I am rushing and hacking away at this thing in my very little free time given how short of time we have. On top of that, I don't seem to be the only person with this in mind because Bungie.net downloads are easily 10x slower than they were prior to the announcement. This is causing some 404 errors which will absolutely crash this script, but I can only say to run it again (and it will take a while....).


To use - put gamertag into any of the blanks on the left (so you can add all your 2 months), and click Download.  This will take a WHILE.  

Parsing takes under 3 seconds and will give you a nice printout of some random stats I programmed in.  I'm open to more. Put people you want to compare yourself against in the fields as well (so you can put your friend's tag + their 2 months) and get a cumulative head to head for ranked game k/d.

I'm actually considering expanding this to ~~Halo 3~~ Halo Reach, but time is limited.
